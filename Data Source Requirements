# DATA SOURCE REQUIREMENTS
### Goal
The goal of the data sources used for this project is to ensure that there is reliable data that is consistent in regards to key filters (address attributes like zip, street address, or city name) in order to have different dataset queries result in dynamic results based on the User's submission in the UI (defined as the person ho is entering filter slections on the UI).
Data Sources will be derived from available crime statistics, school performance scores (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/), and recreation areas (google maps).
