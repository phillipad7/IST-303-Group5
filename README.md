# PROJECT: IDEAL RELOCATION (TO BE RENAMED)
This web application was conceptualized to enable the user to identify their ideal housing option, 
be it rental or ownership via the use of self-identified importance on various parameters such as
crime rate risk levels and proximity to area amenities (schools based on performance rankings, grocery stores,
gas stations, banks, restauarants, etc.), recreation space (hiking and biking trails, parks, etc.) that
coincide with selected rental or sales ranges, bedroom/bathroom combinations, and other housing-related 
specifications.
